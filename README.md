## Key Findings

### Sales and Profit by Category

- Furnitureâ€™s margin is below the overall average.
- Recommendation: Prioritize products with higher margins for marketing.

### Profit by Sub-Category

- Recommendation: Increase promotion for Copiers and reevaluate pricing or stock strategy for Tables.

### Sales and Profit by Region
